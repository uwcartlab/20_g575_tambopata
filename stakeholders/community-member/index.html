             an indigenous community with recognized
            land rights lying adjacent to the Tambopata National Reserve. The Ese’eja were originally a nomadic community
            living in the region around Tambopata for centuries. They have deep ecological knowledge and a strong spiritual
            connection to Amazonian ecosystems. Though individual communities like the one at Infierno won legal communal
            title to certain lands in 1974, the Ese’eja have lost access to many of their sacred sites and to areas they
            once relied on for hunting, fishing, and gathering. Today the Ese’eja Indigenous Territory of Infierno covers
            only 9,558

             far less than their original homeland.
          </p>

          <p>Ramón’s primary concern is that his people are losing rights to their ancestral lands. Like other Ese’eja, he’s
            unhappy that the Peruvian government and other outsiders are making decisions about their ancestral lands without
            consulting leaders in the Federation of Native Peoples

             Ramón is adamant that indigenous people should control their own destiny.
          </p>

          <p> He is also thinking about different ways that his home Ese’eja community in Infierno can secure more income. His
            community has an

            The Ese’eja own the tourism lodge built by the company in Infierno, and Rainforest Expeditions handles the marketing and management. Together,
            they share the profits. Some of Ramon’s relatives have good jobs working at the lodge. But other Ese’eja distrust
            tourism companies to equitably share tourism revenue. They think it might be better to follow the example of the
            Harakmbut indigenous community living in an indigenous territory called Kotzimba (also adjacent to Tambopata Reserve).
            Harakmbut residents are mining gold throughout their Territory using heavy machinery and mercury. Although the damage
            is severe, they have become wealthy from mining. Alternatively, Ramón has heard rumors about forest carbon projects
            associated with an international climate change mitigation mechanism known as

             a Peruvian conservation company, has REDD projects that pay communities to
            store carbon in the forests of Tambopata National Reserve, but he does not know the contract conditions or if the contract
            will benefit native communities. Meanwhile, Ramón is troubled by reports that a third Tambopata-adjacent Ese’eja Indigenous
            territory to the east (Palma Real) has suffered invasions by outside miners and loggers, some of whom are violent.
