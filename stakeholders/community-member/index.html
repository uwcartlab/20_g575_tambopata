            a nomadic community living in the region around Tambopata for centuries. They have deep ecological knowledge and a strong spiritual
            connection to Amazonian ecosystems. Though individual communities like the one at Infierno won legal communal
            title to certain lands in 1974, the Ese’eja have lost access to many of their sacred sites and to areas they
            once relied on for hunting, fishing, and gathering. Today the Ese’eja Indigenous Territory of Infierno covers

          <p>Ramon’s primary concern is that his people are losing rights to their ancestral lands. Like other Ese’eja, he’s

            they share the profits. Some of Ramon’s relatives have good jobs working at the lodge, but other Ese’eja distrust
            tourism companies to equitably share tourism revenue. They think it might be better to follow the example of the
            Harakmbut indigenous community living in an indigenous territory called Kotzimba (also adjacent to the Tambopata National Reserve).
            Harakmbut residents are mining gold throughout their territory using heavy machinery and mercury. Although the damage
            is severe, they have become wealthy from mining. Alternatively, Ramon has heard rumors about forest carbon projects
