				<h2>Co-Founder of Rainforest Expeditions:</h2>
        <img src="expeditions.jpg" alt=" " width="50%">
          <p>
            Oscar Perez is a Peruvian who is passionate about biodiversity conservation but believes that saving the rainforest must be profitable to be successful.
            To this end, he built Rainforest Expeditions, a high-end eco-tourism company that is committed to sharing revenue with indigenous peoples living in
            the forest. Oscar’s company built a luxurious lodge in the Ese’eja Indigenous Territory of Infierno (with permission from the Ese’eja leaders). The lodge,
            called “Posada Amazonas,” has received international awards for its partnership model of co-ownership with the Ese’eja community.
          </p>

          <p>
            The strategic alliance between Rainforest Expeditions and the Ese’eja Infierno community has had great success as well as challenges. The Infierno community
            and the company co-manage the lodge and share the lodge’s profits. Several Infierno community members (as well as some family members of Brazil nut harvesters)
            have full-time jobs at the lodge. Perez has taken the time to train Ese’eja employees and some have gone on to start their own independent lodges.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, there have also been challenges. Some Ese’eja families used their share of the tourism profits to expand their agricultural fields near the lodge.
            One of his biggest headaches is that some Ese’eja individuals insist on hunting in their territory, which makes it very difficult for tourists to see wildlife
            when they are on tours. Oscar is even more worried and angry about the surge in illegal mining activities along the rivers in the Reserve. His tourists complain
            when they see mining along rivers and in the forest. They paid to visit pristine Amazon forest! He hopes recent crackdowns by the Peruvian military will
            discourage mining, but fears that miners will take over the Buffer Zone area and re-enter the Reserve.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ultimately Oscar is optimistic that tourism will continue to grow in Tambopata and play a significant role in protecting forests and providing jobs.
