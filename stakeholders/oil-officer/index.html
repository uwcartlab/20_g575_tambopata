            Mariella Silva works for <i>Palmas del Peru</i>, a leading company in Peru’s growing oil palm industry. Oil palm production is booming in the Peruvian
            Amazon, especially in San Martin and Ucayali. Mariella’s job is to find new regions in Peru to promote oil palm production. In fact, a large area

            of Peru is suitable for oil palm production. She hopes to convince people in Tambopata of the advantages of oil palm by pointing
            to the high global demand for palm oil and the big profits made by producers in other areas. Although oil palm producers have been criticized for
            displacing smallholder farmers, Mariella’s company is committed to working <i>with</i> smallholders.

            She knows that local conservationists fear that some companies will clear primary and secondary natural forests to plant oil palm trees, or that
            companies will buy land from local farmers growing food, thus forcing them to clear forest elsewhere for new agricultural fields. Other opponents
            point out that oil palm plantations need to be large (~1,000 ha) to be profitable. Mariella defends her company on the grounds that they are
            committed to transparency and sustainability, and she sees

            farming cooperatives, and other third-party suppliers who can commit to not
            using slash-and-burn techniques when clearing their land, and who can promise to avoid areas with high conservation value when choosing where to
            develop new oil palm plantations on their lands. In exchange, Mariella is confident that her company can offer a price premium for farmers’ sustainable
            oil palm production. Her company is also looking for land to purchase to develop its own plantations, and she believes her company’s larger size can
            optimize efficiency in their use of resources such as land, water, and energy. She is also confident that her company could attract investors to build
            a local oil palm processing plant, a necessary factor in successful oil palm cultivation. Last, Mariella’s company is a member of the Round Table on
            Sustainable Oil and is committed to ensuring that its crude palm oil production is traceable to its plantations and the smallholder producers they work
            with. That way it’s sustainability pledges can be externally assessed by anyone interested. In short, Mariella is confident that sustainable oil palm
            production can give Tambopata a competitive advantage it has never had.
