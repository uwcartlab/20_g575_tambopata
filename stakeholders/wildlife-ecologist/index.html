          <p>
            Dr. Natalia Ortiz is a Peruvian scientist who studies the ecology of Giant River Otters (<i>Pteronura brasiliensis</i>) in Tambopata, one of the last
            strongholds for this endangered species. She thinks giant otters are magical animals – for one, they are enormous (up to 6 feet long) and live
            in tight-knit social groups that collectively raise pups. They fish cooperatively and are very playful. As top predators, they require large areas
            of intact ecosystems to survive. Natalia is deeply worried that the giant otters in Tambopata are threatened by the same human activities that have
            wiped the species out from other parts of the Amazon. Mining and agriculture are the worst threats, but giant otter populations are also highly
            sensitive to hunting and to overfishing, which is depleting fish stocks in the rivers they call home. Moreover, her research shows that the decline
            of giant river otters signals that many of Tambopata’s natural aquatic habitats are in trouble. The draining of wetlands and lakes for mining and
            agriculture threatens many species, and it also releases significant amounts of carbon.

            Natalia is aware that tourists pay a lot of money to see giant river otters, but she also knows that more local people in more places need to benefit

            in order for communities to protect the environmental conditions necessary to sustain viable populations of otters. It also might be
            possible to justify the conservation of palm swamps (an important habitat for giant otters) because they yield <i>Mauritia flexuosa</i> fruits (aguaje), a popular
            fruit sold in Amazonian towns. But hunting and fishing in the swamps would have to be strictly controlled for otters and other wildlife to persist. Or perhaps
            another way to sustain otter habitat is by protecting the forest through forest carbon projects that pay environmental stewards like

            to conserve their land. Last, she has tried to convince people to save otter habitat as a means to protect the sources of clean drinking water. Ultimately she
            is troubled when people describe wild animals simply as ‘resources’ or rely only on utilitarian arguments. She sees otters, other wildlife, and natural forests
            as having deep intrinsic value, deserving protection beyond human interests. She sees hope in the rising concern for environmental protection among Peruvian
            citizens, including those living in large cities like Lima. She is fighting to protect wildlife for all Peruvians, including future generations.
