            Vicente Molino owns Madera Grande, a large Peruvian logging company. He knows that there are still valuable timber trees in Tambopata, particularly
            in forests far from roads and rivers, and also in eastern Tambopata in the territories of the indigenous

            and Harakmbut peoples. He’s eager to expand his logging company’s operations into these areas, where he knows large profits can be made. For example,
            one single big-leaf mahogany (<i>Swietenia macrophylla</i>) tree can be worth >$10,000.

            Vicente knows logging in Peru has a bad reputation: from ecological destruction to corruption and human rights issues, the logging sector has been
            accused of many offenses. He is appalled by reports that some illegal loggers looking to illicitly log trees without a legal

            murdered indigenous people and other activists who were trying to save forests from the chainsaw. He also hates that there is significant crime and corruption
            in the logging sector. The Peruvian government struggles to adequately monitor logging concessions, and concession owners are known to take advantage
            of this and extract more than their quota, or log without permission. He gets angry when trees are stolen from his concession. But ultimately, he
            believes that legal logging under an adequately managed concessionary system has the potential to be the most profitable of forest extraction activities,
            and also sustainable.

            Certainly, selective logging is more ‘forest-friendly’ than agriculture or gold mining. He is proud of his company’s work to promote

            These projects connect concessionaires (the people who hold logging concessions) to profits from forest carbon offsets markets.
            Concessionaires receive payments for reforesting degraded areas and protecting some old growth on their concessions because this improves carbon
            storage (sequestration). He is certain that it is possible to log a forest without destroying all the biodiversity or releasing too much carbon. To be
            clear, though, he thinks large companies like his are the best positioned to carry out Reduced Impact Logging. His company can afford to employ experts
            in low impact extraction and forest restoration. Moreover, the larger the area of the logging concession, the more feasible it is to log less intensively.
