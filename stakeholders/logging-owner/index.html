				<h2>Owner of Peruvian Logging Company, Madera Grande (Big Timber)</h2>
        <img src="LoggingOwner.jpg" width=500px;>
          <p>
            Vicente Molino owns Madera Grande, a large Peruvian logging company. He knows that there are still valuable timber trees in Tambopata, particularly
            in forests far from roads and rivers, and also in eastern Tambopata in the territories of the indigenous Ese’eja and Harakmbut peoples. He’s eager
            to expand his logging company’s operations into these areas, where he knows large profits can be made. For example, one single big-leaf mahogany
            Swietenia macrophylla) tree can be worth >$10,000.
          </p>

          <p>
            Vicente knows logging in Peru has a bad reputation: from ecological destruction to corruption and human rights issues, the logging sector has been
            accused of many offenses. He is appalled by reports that some illegal loggers looking to illicitly log trees without a legal concession murdered
            indigenous people and other activists who were trying to save forests from the chainsaw. He also hates that there is significant crime and corruption
            in the logging sector. The Peruvian government struggles to adequately monitor logging concessions, and concession owners are known to take advantage
            of this and extract more than their quota, or log without permission. He gets angry when trees are stolen from his concession. But ultimately, he
            believes that legal logging under an adequately managed concessionary system has the potential to be the most profitable of forest extraction activities,
            and also sustainable.
          </p>

          <p>
            Certainly, selective logging is more ‘forest-friendly’ than agriculture or gold mining. He is proud of his company’s work to promote Reduced Impact
            Logging (RIL, also known as Natural Forest Management). Vicente sells timber from RIL sites under the Smart Wood certification program, which allows
            him to get a better price for the timber and eases the extra costs.
          </p>

          <p>
            Vicente is also interested in collaborating with Brazil Nut harvesters. He is confident that the valuable timber trees can be extracted from forests
            without harming Brazil nut harvests, and he knows fine timber is worth far more than Brazil nuts. He’s also interested in working with forest carbon
            projects, like those referred to as REDD+ (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) and promoted by the Peruvian conservation company
            Bosques Amazónicos. These projects connect concessionaires (the people who hold logging concessions) to profits from forest carbon offsets markets.
            Concessionaires receive payments for reforesting degraded areas and protecting some old growth on their concessions because this improves carbon
            storage (sequestration). He is certain that it is possible to log a forest without destroying all the biodiversity or releasing too much carbon. To be
            clear, though, he thinks large companies like his are the best positioned to carry out Reduced Impact Logging. His company can afford to employ experts
            in low impact extraction and forest restoration. Moreover, the larger the area of the logging concession, the more feasible it is to log less intensively.
