				<h2>Leader of Mining Federation (FEDEMIN)</h2>
          <p>
            Miguel Yallico is disgusted by the poverty he sees in Tambopata, especially because he knows there are millions of dollars of gold lying buried in the
            region’s soils. Miguel mines gold in three places in Tambopata, but like &gt;90% of local miners, he operates illegally. He is not afraid of punishment
            because Peru’s government agencies lack personnel to fully enforce mining regulations. Besides, Miguel has many powerful connections and he usually gets
            advance warning when an enforcement event is imminent.
          </p>

          <p>
            Miguel is thrilled that gold prices are rising and more people are coming to Tambopata to strike it rich. But he’s troubled that labor conditions for miners
            in Tambopata have gotten more dangerous in recent years. Corruption and violence have soared, and he directly blames the government. He argues that the high
            cost of the Ministry’s mining permit process, the slow function of its bureaucracy, and the endless red tape make local miners resort to working illegally.
          </p>

          <p>
            Miguel’s fiery public speeches decrying the government and opposing environmental regulations have made him popular and politically powerful. When asked
            about the environmental impacts of mining, he fights back. He accuses environmentalists of indifference to the poor and of being beholden to hegemonic
            interests of global northern countries. He asks, who is polluting more, us, poor miners? Or big rich countries in the North who fill the sky with CO2? <!--fix 2 -->
            He urges his fellow miners to disregard the rules about applying for legal mining concessions. These rules are unreasonable and interfere with the basic
            principal that every Peruvian has the right to mine – after all, mining has historically been part of their identity and dignity. He thinks mining is also
            the best option for local indigenous people and that roads should be built into their territories to facilitate gold mining. Miguel is confident that mining
            is the best path for local economic development. As the region becomes more prosperous, environmental problems can be addressed, e.g. trees can be planted
            in areas damaged by mining. In the meantime, if any environmentalist wants to pay for more sustainable mining equipment, that’s fine, just don’t ask the poor
            miners to make any more sacrifices. They are doing back-breaking, dangerous work.
