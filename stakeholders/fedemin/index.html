				<h2>What's this assignment about?</h2>
				<br>
				<p>
					Participatory zoning initiatives are underway in scores of protected areas in the tropics where forests are rich, but people are poor. Ideally, participatory zoning promises to
					<ul>
						<li>Balance conservation and development goals at the landscape scale</li>
						<li>Bring competing interest groups together to negotiate rules and create a shared sense of landscape</li>
						<li>Encourage greater stakeholder buy-in and avoid costly top-down enforcement</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					In this exercise, you will assume the role of a real-life stakeholder from Tambopata. Based on your stakeholder’s interests, you will define your land-use priorities for TNR, find allies, and negotiate with your opponents
					as you collectively negotiate and vote on one of four zoning proposal maps created in the local participatory planning process. In thinking about which map should guide land use activities in Tambopata’s future,
					consider the following: Why do your interests deserve priority? What kinds of activities will generate income without destroying biodiversity? Does your character have special interest in a certain area, e.g. the fertile,
					gold-rich and scenic riversides? Which areas have old-growth forests? Conversely, which areas are already deforested? Which activities are taking place up-stream from your character’s areas of interest?
				</p><p>
					You will advocate for your stakeholder’s vision for Tambopata by participating in a role-played roundtable and writing a position paper. At the roundtable and in the paper,
					you will identify the map you think best matches your character’s priorities, and (most importantly) defend your character’s position using <b>moral</b>, <b>environmental</b> and/or <b>economic</b> arguments:
				</p><p>
					<u><b>Moral Arguments:</u></b> Who should benefit from Tambopata’s forests and why? The area's original indigenous inhabitants? Or the largest group, namely small-scale farmers of mixed ancestry,
					some of whom have lived in Tambopata for decades, others only a few years? Which kinds of land use activities can offer security for Tambopata’s residents?
					Do Tambopata's forests and wildlife deserve protection apart from human economic concerns?
				</p><p>
					<u><b>Environmental Arguments:</u></b> What land uses are most likely to maintain biodiversity and/or other ecosystem services? How can environmentally destructive practices be mitigated?
					Why should certain activities be conducted in certain areas of TNR (e.g. where does old-growth forest persist? Where has forest already been cleared?
					Which areas are up/down stream? Which areas are closer to the Bahuaja-Sonene National Park?)?
				</p><p>
					<u><b>Economic Arguments:</u></b> Tambopata is poor. What kind of economic activities should have priority? Why? Which kinds of land use activities can generate capital and taxes to improve Tambopata’s services?
				</p>

				<h2>Tambopata, Peru: <br>Protecting forests and empowering local communities</h2>
				<br>
				<p>
					The Tambopata National Reserve (TNR) was created in 1990 to protect one of the most biologically diverse and least disturbed forests on the planet. The region is also home to indigenous people, like the Ese’eja,
					who see their very survival threatened by development. Many other local residents see Tambopata as a poor region of Peru that contains untapped reserves of timber, gold, and farmland.
				</p><p>
					To balance biodiversity protection with economic development, officials are promoting participatory zoning of the 272,000 hectares of land within TNR.
					Leading this zoning exercise is Peru’s Ministry of the Environment. The Ministry has invited local stakeholder groups to propose zoning maps and promote their map at a public roundtable.
					The consensus map selected at the roundtable will guide future management.

				<h2>Key events in the history of Tambopata, Peru</h2>
				<br>
				<p>
					<b>1890-1915:</b> The global demand for rubber leads companies to penetrate the forests of Tambopata to tap rubber trees. These companies bring the first wave of colonists, diseases, and market economies to the region.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>1930:</b> People begin to extract Brazil nuts from Tambopata for international markets. Small-scale gold mining begins.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>1990s:</b> The Tambopata Candamo Reserve Zone (TCRZ) is created as a temporary reserve on 1.5 million hectares, including uninhabited forests and areas settled by ~6000 people. The local farmers’
					federation FADEMAD and a local conservation group, Conservation Internacional-Peru (CI-Peru), work together to classify land in the region according to its agricultural potential and create a national park
					(“Bahuaja-Sonene”) (see VIDEO “Return to Tambopata”).
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Late 1990s, early 2000’s:</b> Participatory mapping and zoning exercises resume.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>2000:</b> The Peruvian Congress passes a new Sustainable Forestry Law. A moratorium is temporarily placed on logging in the Peruvian Amazon due to “destructive, corrupt, and wasteful” practices.
					 Local loggers revolt and burn government vehicles and confiscated timber. They demand to log forests and to dissolve the TCRZ. The protestors set up a roadblock near the airport.
					 One person killed, offices burned. After three days, anti-riot police from Lima squelch the protest with tear gas and arrests. INRENA lifts the logging moratorium.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>2008:</b>  As global economic crisis sets in, gold prices soar, and a gold rush brings tens of thousands of Peruvians to Tambopata.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>2012:</b> SERNANP uses an emergency decree to halt mining within the Tambopata Reserve. Public riots break out. The National Federation of Miners of Peru strikes and burns government buildings.
					Six people die in the ensuing conflict. The decree stands. Peru’s military evicts most of the miners from the Reserve. Mining continues (illegally) in the proposed Buffer Zone.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>2020:</b> Mining conflicts continue to this day…

            Miguel Yallico is disgusted by the poverty he sees in Tambopata, especially because he knows there are millions of dollars of gold lying buried in the
            region’s soils. Miguel mines gold in three places in Tambopata, but like 90 percent of local miners, he operates illegally. He is not afraid of punishment
            because Peru’s government agencies lack personnel to fully enforce mining regulations. Besides, Miguel has many powerful connections, and he usually gets
            advance warning when an enforcement event is imminent.
          </p>

          <p>
            Miguel is thrilled that gold prices are rising and more people are coming to Tambopata to strike it rich. But he’s troubled that labor conditions for miners
            in Tambopata have gotten more dangerous in recent years. Corruption and violence have soared, and he directly blames the Peruvian government and its Ministry
            of Energy and Mines. He argues that the high cost of the  Ministry’s mining permit process, the slowness of the bureaucracy, and the endless red tape make
            local miners resort to working illegally.
          </p>

            Miguel’s fiery public speeches decrying the government and opposing environmental regulations have made him popular and politically powerful. When asked
            about the environmental impacts of mining, he fights back. He accuses environmentalists of indifference to the poor and of being beholden to hegemonic
            interests of global northern countries. He asks, "who is polluting more: us

            and that roads should be built into their territories to facilitate gold mining. Miguel is confident that mining
            is the best path for local economic development. As the region becomes more prosperous, environmental problems can be addressed, e.g. trees can be planted
            in areas damaged by mining. In the meantime, if any environmentalist wants to pay for more sustainable mining equipment, that’s fine, just don’t ask the poor
            miners to make any more sacrifices. They are doing back-breaking, dangerous work.
