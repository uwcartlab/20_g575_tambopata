            Miguel Yallico is disgusted by the poverty he sees in Tambopata, especially because he knows there are millions of dollars of gold lying buried in the
            region’s soils. Miguel mines gold in three places in Tambopata, but like 90 percent of local miners, he operates illegally. He is not afraid of punishment
            because Peru’s government agencies lack personnel to fully enforce mining regulations. Besides, Miguel has many powerful connections, and he usually gets
            advance warning when an enforcement event is imminent.
          </p>

          <p>
            Miguel is thrilled that gold prices are rising and more people are coming to Tambopata to strike it rich. But he’s troubled that labor conditions for miners
            in Tambopata have gotten more dangerous in recent years. Corruption and violence have soared, and he directly blames the Peruvian government and its Ministry
            of Energy and Mines. He argues that the high cost of the  Ministry’s mining permit process, the slowness of the bureaucracy, and the endless red tape make
            local miners resort to working illegally.
          </p>

          <p>
            Miguel’s fiery public speeches decrying the government and opposing environmental regulations have made him popular and politically powerful. When asked
            about the environmental impacts of mining, he fights back. He accuses environmentalists of indifference to the poor and of being beholden to hegemonic
            interests of global northern countries. He asks, "who is polluting more: us

            and that roads should be built into their territories to facilitate gold mining. Miguel is confident that mining
            is the best path for local economic development. As the region becomes more prosperous, environmental problems can be addressed, e.g. trees can be planted
            in areas damaged by mining. In the meantime, if any environmentalist wants to pay for more sustainable mining equipment, that’s fine, just don’t ask the poor
            miners to make any more sacrifices. They are doing back-breaking, dangerous work.
