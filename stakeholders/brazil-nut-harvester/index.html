              Maria strongly believes that local poor citizens should have priority to use natural resources
              in the Reserve, but they must do so sustainably. Her livelihood depends on access to the old growth
              forests that contain large Brazil nut trees. These trees take decades to start producing nuts and
              cannot be cultivated in plantations. The most productive trees are over a century old and more than
              ten stories high. By law, Brazil nut trees cannot be felled, but they are commonly cleared during
              agriculture or mining.
            </p>

            <p>Brazil nut harvesting is hard work. Brazil nut trees are dispersed across the forest. Thus,
              Maria must walk a wide area to gather the cannonball-like seed pods that fall from each Brazil nut
              tree. Even though it’s labor intensive, most environmentalists believe Brazil nut harvesting is one
              of the most sustainable ways for local poor people to make money off the forest. Brazil nut trees are
              also a

            <p>Maria fears that mining and agriculture will destroy these forests and, ultimately, her family’s
              livelihood. But she’s also worried that she can’t make enough money only harvesting Brazil nuts,
              especially given the rudimentary infrastructure available for transporting and processing the nuts.
              Thus, Maria is exploring other options.
            </p>

            <p>Some Brazil nut harvesters are trying to attract tourists to pay for the experience of harvesting
              Brazil nuts, and the sons and daughters of some Brazil nut harvesters already have jobs
              in tourism (see VIDEO). <!--Are we using this older video here? -->
              Maria has also learned that <u>outside</u> the Reserve, some Brazil nut harvesters
              are partnering with
              <!--retrieve pop-up with description and link to Big Timber  -->
              <span class="popup" onclick="popupLog()">loggers

                </span>
              </span>
              who claim to be using methods that extract timber without damaging Brazil nut trees. Logging is currently not allowed in the Brazil nut
              in the Reserve, but some Brazil nut harvesters think it would be a good way to add value to the standing forest
              and help compete against mining or agriculture. Other Brazil nut harvesters suspect loggers will seriously damage
              the forest. Last, Maria has heard that some other Brazil nut harvesters have signed contracts with a
              Peruvian conservation company, <a href="http://www.bosques-amazonicos.com/en/our-projects/redd-in-concessions-of-brazil-nuts-in-madre-de-dios-peru"target="_blank"><i>Bosques Amazónicos</i></a>,
              to be paid for protecting forest and planting Brazil nut tree seedlings in their concessions. The company
              has also promised to build a Brazil nut processing plant. The payments come from a forest carbon fund
              associated with global climate change mitigation efforts known as
              <!--retrieve glossary term REDD+ & link to gloassary -->

                countries.</span>
              </a>
               Maria thinks these are all promising opportunities; but, above all, what Brazil nut harvesters lack the most is access
              to a better Brazil nut processing plant.
