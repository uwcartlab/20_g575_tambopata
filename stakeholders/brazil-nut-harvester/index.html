				<h2>Brazil Nut Harvester</h2>
        <img src="brazilnut.jpg" width=500px;> 
				    <p>Maria Silva has harvested Brazil nuts since she was a child. Her family holds a 40-year
              concession for harvesting Brazil nuts in 500 hectares of old growth forest in the northeastern
              part of the Tambopata National Reserve. As a member of the local Agrarian Federation (FADEMAD),
              Maria strongly believes that local poor citizens should have priority to use natural resources
              in the Reserve, but they must do so sustainably. Her livelihood depends on access to the old growth
              forests that contain large Brazil nut trees. These trees take decades to start producing nuts and
              cannot be cultivated in plantations. The most productive trees are over a century old and more than
              ten stories high. By law, Brazil nut trees cannot be felled, but they are commonly cleared during
              agriculture or mining.
            </p>

            <p>Brazil nut harvesting is hard work. Brazil nut trees are dispersed across the forest. Thus,
              María must walk a wide area to gather the cannonball-like seed pods that fall from each Brazil nut
              tree. Even though it’s labor intensive, most environmentalists believe Brazil nut harvesting is one
              of the most sustainable ways for local poor people to make money off the forest. Brazil nut trees are
              also a keystone species.
            </p>

            <p>Maria fears that mining and agriculture will destroy these forests and, ultimately, her family’s
              livelihood. But she’s also worried that she can’t make enough money only harvesting Brazil nuts,
              especially given the rudimentary infrastructure available for transporting and processing the nuts.
              Thus, Maria is exploring other options.
            </p>

            <p>Some Brazil nut harvesters are trying to attract tourists to pay for the experience of harvesting
              Brazil nuts (see VIDEO). And the sons and daughters of some Brazil nut harvesters already have jobs
              in tourism (see VIDEO). Maria has also learned that outside the Reserve, some Brazil nut harvesters
              are partnering with loggers who claim to be using methods that extract timber without damaging Brazil
              nut trees (link to logger). Logging is currently not allowed in the Brazil nut concessions in the Reserve,
              but some Brazil nut harvesters think it would be a good way to add value to the standing forest and help
              compete against mining or agriculture. Other Brazil nut harvesters suspect loggers will seriously damage
              the forest. Last, Maria has heard that some other Brazil nut harvesters have signed contracts with a
              Peruvian conservation company, Bosques Amazónicos, to be paid for protecting forest and planting Brazil
              nut tree seedlings in their concessions. The company has also promised to build a Brazil nut processing
              plant. The payments come from a forest carbon fund associated with global climate change mitigation efforts
              known as REDD+ (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation). Maria thinks these are all
              promising opportunities but above all, what Brazil nut harvesters lack the most is access to a better Brazil
              nut processing plant.
