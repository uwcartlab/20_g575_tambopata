            Pedro Gomez is a long-time resident of Tambopata and a gold miner who has been mining the banks of the Malinowski river for 20 years. Pedro first turned
            to gold mining when his family was in an economic crisis and he desperately needed to make some cash fast. Like many of his mining friends, he calls himself
            an

            for a permit to Peru’s Ministry of Energy and Mines, but he can’t afford to pay for the environmental impact assessment a legal permit would require. As a
            result, Pedro, like the vast majority of the miners he knows, works at the margins of the law. Since Pedro has been operating illegally, the military has
            destroyed his mining equipment twice as part of their crackdown on illegal mining in the region. Now he must work for another miner who buys bigger equipment
            with the aid of crime syndicates. He is alarmed by increasing violence in mining areas and sees that other old-timer artisanal miners are arming themselves
            and taking turns at guard when they are at the riverbanks. Pedro has many friends in

            an organization that is fighting for the rights of miners. Mining has grown in Tambopata in recent years, and larger-scale miners have begun to push artisanal
            miners as well as farmers off their land with threats of violence. Given the rising global demand for gold, Pedro thinks it is impossible to stop mining in
            Tambopata and that the government should focus on regulating the activity and helping local residents benefit from the activity instead of outsiders. Pedro is
            disturbed by news reports that mining is contaminating the region’s water and fish, yet he is proud to be a miner. He just wishes he could work independently,
            with no fear of violence, and that he could afford to use lower polluting mining technology.
