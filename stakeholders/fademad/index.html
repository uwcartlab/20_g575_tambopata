				<h2>Leader of Agrarian Federation (FADEMAD):</h2>
        <img src="fademad.jpg" alt=" " width="50%">
        <p>
          Alan Moreno leads FADEMAD, a grassroots political organization that represents ~5000 small farmers in the
          <!--retrieve pop-up with glossary term Madre de Dios and link to gloassary -->
          <a class="popup" onclick="popupMadre()">Madre de Dios
            <span class="popupText" id="myPopup4">Madre de Dios: (literally “Mother of God”) the name of the 8.5 million ha Department (region)
            surrounding Tambopata. It is the least populated area in Peru (~ 1 person/km2).</span>

           region. FADEMAD’s goal is to improve the quality of life of its members, both long-time residents and more-recently settled colonists.
        </p>

        <p>
          Alan believes that poor farmers’ quality of life depends on a healthy environment. Thus, he tries to defend local farmers AND the forest. He grew up
          in the Amazon, as did his father and grandfather. He’s proud of his farm. He’s planted a wide variety of crops together in a way that protects the soil,
          includes trees, and attracts wildlife. He thinks this form of agriculture (called agroforestry) is the best hope for protecting the environment while
          also providing local citizens food and income. As leader of FADEMAD, he has worked closely with conservationists to help farmers learn about agroforestry.
        </p>

        <p>
          He’s also intrigued by new opportunities for local poor farmers to earn extra income by selling certain crops–especially cacao–under a certification system.
          Growing cacao can be a lot of work for very little money, but if cacao could be sold under a certification scheme, this could create a sustainable source
          of income for Tambopata’s farmers.
        </p>

        <p>
          He is also proud of the

           in FADEMAD. They have a special connection to the forest. Alan is growing worried as other members of FADEMAD
          are becoming more powerful, particularly

            </span>
          </span>
           many of whom are more interested in monoculture agriculture, mining, and cattle. To save his
          political career, Alan recently tried to display a more pro-agriculture stance and publicly announced that local farmers’ rights must take priority over
          biodiversity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Alan knows that many FADEMAD members also work as

          </span>
          gold miners to supplement their farming income. But he is disturbed by the devastating impact of mining
          on the forest and water supplies. He is troubled by reports that some miners are threatening local farmers with violence, demanding access to gold lying
          beneath their lands.
        </p>

        <p>
          Alan and his fellow FADEMAD members are wary of forest carbon projects–like those referred to as
          <!--retrieve glossary term REDD+ & link to gloassary -->
          <a class="popup" onclick="popupREDD()">REDD+

          (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation)– that promise to pay farmers not to clear forest on their
          land for many years. He questions whether the extra money will be enough for farmers to tie up parts of their land in
          lengthy conservation contracts. After all, what does a poor farmer have to offer her growing children but her land? But Alan
          is interested in carbon projects that pay farmers to adopt agroforestry, including cacao agroforestry systems.

          he does see promise in ‘agro-tourism’.
