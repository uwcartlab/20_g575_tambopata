				<h2>Colonist Farmer:</h2>
        <img src="riberenyo.jpg" alt=" " width="50%">
        <p>José Herrera and his family moved five years ago to the Tambopata Reserve in search of new farm land and opportunities. They left Cuzco, a city
          in the Peruvian Andes, due to land scarcity and unemployment. Immigrants to the Amazon, like José and his family, are often referred to as ‘colonists’.
          Like other colonists, upon his arrival, José claimed 30 hectares of land along the highway. Every year José and his family plant rice and corn in fields
          cleared in the forest until the soil becomes ‘tired’ and less productive. Then, they convert the old field to cattle pasture and clear a new field in the
          forest. They eat most of the food they grow and sell the surplus if they have any.
        </p>

        <p>Like other poor residents of Tambopata, José is worried about his family’s financial future. He hopes someday to buy a truck and sell food in town or
          to local miners. Or, he might convert his whole farm into a pasture and get a job in the city. Some of his neighbors are talking about selling their land
          to oil palm companies, and then moving deeper into the forest to claim new farmland. But José does not have legal title to his land and doesn’t think he’d
          be paid much for it. He is a member of the Agrarian Federation (FADEMAD), a local political organization, and has heard some members talk about transitioning
          from shifting agriculture to agroforestry. He might even be able to start growing organic cacao (the source of chocolate) and sell it via a local marketing
          coop that could negotiate a better price. Consumer demand for certified chocolate is on the rise. But José has no knowledge or experience with tropical tree
          crops like cacao – he would need training to pursue agroforestry. He also wonders how he could survive financially while waiting the five years for the cacao
          trees to bear fruit. He could always turn to working for his friends in their illegal gold mining camp. Gold mining is back-breaking, often dangerous work,
          but if you’re lucky, you can make a lot of money in a short time.
        </p>

        </p>Jose and most other FADEMAD members are poor, but they are the largest interest group in the region, and they have strength in numbers. José and his fellow
        colonists keep pushing their leaders to take a firm pro-agriculture stand. They know they need financial, technical, and political support to be successful farmers
        in Tambopata.
        </p>
