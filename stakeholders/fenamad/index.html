				<h2>Leader of the Federation of Native Peoples (FENAMAD):</h2>
          <p>
            Agustín Achuni leads FENAMAD, a grassroots political organization of indigenous peoples. FENAMAD’s mission is to defend indigenous ancestral lands
            from outside interests and gain authority to manage their legally recognized territories as they choose. Many indigenous communities in this region
            of the Amazon lost large tracts of their original ancestral lands due to Peru’s land reform policies in the 1970s.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some communities who are now members of FENAMAD, like Ese’eja and Harakmbut communities, managed to win legal recognition of smaller parts of their
            ancestral territories. These communities now have legal communal titles but have lost access to many of their sacred sites and to the areas in which
            they relied on for traditional hunting, fishing, and gathering.
          </p>

          <p>
            As leader of FENAMAD, Agustín is deeply frustrated by the political marginalization of indigenous peoples, and his strongest priority is to regain
            indigenous control of ancestral lands. He believes that the entire Tambopata Reserve and Bahuaja Sonene Park belong to the Ese-eja, the Harakmbut,
            and other ethnic groups in the region. He also thinks that Peru’s Park Service should co-manage these protected areas in partnership with the Ese’eja,
            Harakmbut, and other native groups.
          </p>

          <p>
            Agustín is also helping FENAMAD members devise ways in which their communities can be sustainable over the long term. Some FENAMAD members believe
            ecotourism can be a profitable business for indigenous communities and a source of jobs for individuals. Others, however, see ecotourism as an activity
            that commercializes their traditional culture and inequitably distributes the work and the financial benefits involved. Plus, some critics argue that
            tourism and wildlife hunting are simply not compatible.
          </p>

          <p>
            Similarly, FENAMAD members are divided in their opinion of forest carbon projects–like those referred to as REDD+ (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation
            and Forest Degradation) and promoted by the Peruvian conservation company Bosques Amazónicos– that promise to pay indigenous communities not to cut forest
            on their land for many years. However, other FENAMAD members strongly oppose forest carbon projects, arguing that yet again indigenous communities have
            had little say in how these REDD+ projects are designed and managed.
          </p>

          <p>
            Gold mining has brought about another tension within FENAMAD’s constituency. Many FENAMAD members now work as gold miners. Harkmbut people are intensively
            mining for gold within their Kotsimba Territory and keeping all other miners out. Meanwhile, the Ese’eja people living in the Infierno Territory do not
            permit any mining on their lands but they extract gold from neighboring regions. Agustín is pained by his people’s poverty and thinks that if mining must
            happen it should directly benefit indigenous peoples. FENAMAD leaders are considering joining the Mining Federation in their public protests against the
            Peruvian government’s newly imposed mining restrictions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Agustin is also under heavy pressure from some FENAMAD members to help them stop illegal logging by commercial operators on native lands. He is still
            grieving and furious about the fact that illegal loggers murdered indigenous leaders who were trying to defend their forests in other parts of the
            Peruvian Amazon.
