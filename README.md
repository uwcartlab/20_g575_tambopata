### Team Project - Tambopata

### Team Members:

1. Kyle McNair

3. Vincent Cunningham
4. Matthew Laska

### Final Proposal:
1. Persona/Schema
    1. Target Group Profile (Persona) 

    Name & Position: Sam Johnson, Student 
    Background: Sam is a student in Geography 339 participating in a class project to learn about participatory land use management through role-playing and discussion with class peers. For their final project, students will re-enact the real-life debates of Tambopata, Peru to determine the best land use proposal agreement for the community of stakeholders. Sam’s instructor and teaching assistant have provided students access to the detail-rich class website. Through this website Sam will identify and learn the special interests associated with one particular stakeholder and compare all other stakeholders to better understand where to find allies with similar interests. Sam will also compare four zoning proposals and filter out which one best represents her stakeholder’s interests. Sam’s goal is to successfully defend her stakeholder’s position and come to an agreement with the other represented stakeholders on the most practical land use proposal. As a busy undergrad sophomore, Sam is a tech savvy millennial taking 16 credits this semester. Utilizing the class website on her phone to prepare for the upcoming round table discussion makes working on the go a huge benefit. 

    2. Schema

    User Case Scenario 1 (desktop)
    Upon entering the website, the student sees an “About Tambopata” pop-up page displaying a description about the academic use of the site, the assignment, and a tutorial of how to navigate. Upon exiting the pop-up, the “Stakeholder List Page” appears with character images shown on the landing page. The student, assigned the Colonist Farmer stakeholder, selects the relevant stakeholder image and gets redirected to the “Stakeholder Page”. On arrival, the student views an image and description of the character. As the student scrolls through the description, they notice an embedded video and callout glossary terms that can be retrieved as well as references that link to other stakeholder character pages for easy comparison. The student also notices they can retrieve a “Menu Bar” on all pages, indicated with an information icon. The menu contains links to all the pages, making the site easy to navigate. The student finds the Menu is easily minimized when not in use. The student then selects the “Proposals Page” where they find four interactive maps. Here, the student zooms and pans to different features of the map. By hovering over an area of interest on the legend, the student retrieves a description of the areas land use. The student sees an affordance to select between three map overlays as well as a slider to adjust the opacity overlay of the zone layers. Finally, the student finds the “Acknowledgements Page” containing information on the exercise creators, cartographers, website administrators, and information regarding the promotion and use of the website. Concluding the project, the TA provides access to the Tambopata Outcome’s page so students can view the actual results based on two slider maps. These maps give sequence and overlay of two identical locations, but different temporal dates. The student can also retrieve other information by selecting a tab, or through scrolling.
