    		<h1>Participatory Zoning Goals</h1>
                <p>Participatory zoning processes like the one we re-enacted are underway in scores of protected areas in the tropics where biodiversity overlaps with poverty and management
                    institutions are weak and underfunded. Ideally, participatory zoning balances ecosystem conservation and economic development goals across large areas and among diverse
                    stakeholders. Community mapping can bolster traditional resource use claims. Zoning can also highlight areas of special importance for protecting water and wildlife.<p>
                <p>So, in sum, why go through all the effort to engage stakeholders and do participatory zoning?<p>

                <ul>
                    <li>To balance conservation and development goals at the landscape scale.</li>
                    <li>To bring competing interest groups together to negotiate rules and create a shared sense of landscape.</li>
                    <li>To encourage greater stakeholder buy-in and avoid costly top-down enforcement.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>What happened in Tambopata in real life?</h2>
                <p>Participatory zoning has been underway in one form or another in Tambopata for nearly two decades. Some past participatory zoning efforts have focused on agricultural
                    development or mining outside protected areas. Our re-enactment matches an effort launched in 2001 that was funded by the Macarthur Foundation and led by Peruvian
                    conservationists. In reality, more than a dozen zoning maps were proposed by various stakeholder groups over the course of years. We selected and simplified four of
                    these proposed maps to use in this exercise.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

    <div id="basic-desc" class = "container slide3">

            <p>Given that this exercise was funded and led by conservationists, groups considered ‘forest friendly’ were privileged from the start, namely Brazil nut harvesters,
                ecotourism operators, ecologists, the Federation of Indigenous peoples (FENAMAD), and the Agrarian Federation (FADEMAD). However, the latter group (FADEMAD,
                the Agrarian Federation) was relatively large and powerful and its members included some miners and loggers. Thus, after several round tables and debates,
                participants chose proposal #2, a simplified version of the map originally proposed by FADEMAD. This map was thought to best balance competing interests. Notably,
                in place of the buffer zone, the zoning participants favored creating a new zoning category (a ‘Community Reserve’) that allowed all kinds of activities, but only
                if they were conducted by Tambopata residents. Miners were allocated the gold-rich riverbanks along the Malinowski in the NW section of the Reserve.</p>

            <p>This consensus map was sent for approval to the central offices of Peru’s Institute of Natural Resources (INRENA) in Lima, where it sat for a year under consideration.
                When INRENA finally sent the formally approved zoning map back to Tambopata, stakeholders were met with a surprise: INRENA designated a large Buffer Zone, arguing that
                ‘Community Reserve’ was not a legally recognized land use zone. INRENA also erased the direct use zone along the Malinowski river meant for mining, hoping this would
                protect the source of water for the growing city of Puerto Maldonado from mercury contamination. Additionally, in 2010 the Peruvian Government established a formal
                mining corridor where mining could legally take place with formal permits; however, mining continues to occur outside of this legally designated area.</p>

            <p>Local reaction to the final, INRENA-approved map was mixed. Indigenous people were disappointed but not surprised that their ancestral lands were not expanded. Some
                Ese’eja citizens were pleased to see ecotourism granted big areas, other Ese’eja opposed this. Brazil nut harvesters were encouraged by the formal public support of
                their activity. The zoning exercise made them feel more confident in their rights to exclude loggers and farmers from the old growth forest where they harvest Brazil
                nuts, but they admit hunting is not controlled. Most participants believed mining on the Malinowski would not stop even if it was forbidden on the zoning map.
                Similarly, many participants felt the Buffer Zone was only a designation on paper, not one that would be enforced in reality.</p>

        <h2>Questions to reflect on:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Do you think your character would approve of the final zoning map?</li>
                <li>Would s/h/ze describe the process as truly ‘participatory’?</li>
                <li>Stepping out of character, do you think Peruvian conservationists leading this exercise made the right choice to limit the voice of mining, industrial agriculture
                    and logging in the zoning process for the Reserve?</li>
                <li>Based on your experience in this activity, in a sentence or two, describe a few opportunities and challenges to taking a participatory approach to zoning.</li>

        <h2>The mixed results of Participatory Zoning at Tambopata</h2>
            <h3><i>Did the participatory zoning exercise succeed at balancing conservation & development at the landscape scale?</i></h3>

            <p><b><i>Failures: </i></b>Despite the zoning effort, some illegal logging continued in the northeastern corner of the TNR and neighboring indigenous territories. Worse,
                as expected, illegal gold mining activities exploded in the Buffer Zone and along the upper Malinowski River. In 2018 alone, mining destroyed over 9,000 hectares of
                forests (that’s about 18,000 football fields).</p>
            <p>The Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project (MAAP) has put together time lapse images that show how gold mining (and related deforestation) has rapidly expanded in
                the Alto Malinowski and La Pampa (and other regions) between 2016-early 2019. Click <a href = "https://maaproject.org/2020/mining_frontiers_peru/" target="_blank">here</a>
                to see them (scroll down to La Pampa, and the Alto Malinowski).</p>

            <p><b><i>Successes: </i></b>Forests in the Tambopata National Reserve (TNR) are still fairly well protected. There is negligible mining in the Reserve (despite the presence
                of gold deposits). Instead, more forest-friendly activities predominate (Brazil nut harvesting and tourism). Moreover, the adjacent one million-hectare Bahuaja-Sonene
                park is mostly protected (due to its remoteness). Importantly, keep in mind that, unlike Tambopata, most participatory zoning in the tropics happens where there is no
                huge, intact national park next door. The social and ecological stakes of participatory zoning are higher when there is no other forested area left for conservation or
                sustainable use.</p>

            <h3><i>Did the participatory zoning exercise succeed at bringing competing groups together to negotiate rules and creating a shared sense of landscape?
                Did it avoid conflicts & costly, top-down enforcement?</i></h3>

            <p><b><i>Failures: </i></b>Conservation continues to be a politically charged issue at Tambopata. Some defiant leaders of loggers and miners have been elected to public
                office by running their campaigns on anti-conservation messages. The explosion of illegal gold mining ultimately required expensive, militarized enforcement (see next).</p>

            <p><b><i>Successes: </i></b>Although participatory zoning didn’t ‘win over’ the entire population of the region to a conservation mindset, it raised public awareness. Prior
                to the exercise most residents knew little about the TNR or its purpose, whereas after, many had a better understanding of the TNR’s conservation objectives. In particular,
                locals had a better awareness of Brazil nut and tourism concessions, the location of the Buffer Zone, etc. Most notably, this activity helped to strengthen a new Local
                Management Committee made up of zoning exercise participants and lead by the former Agrarian Federation (FADEMAD) leader. Together they have achieved remarkable impact,
                e.g. helping the press and civic organizations to publicly protest mercury pollution, creating an anonymous ‘hotline’ to report mining infractions, and blowing the whistle
                on corruption in the mining sector. Confronting mining is very risky given the enormous profits and criminality of many operations. Management Committee leaders regularly
                receive death threats. This Committee is also working with government agencies to improve the mining formalization process. So effective is this committee, that the Peruvian
                government has asked them to coach management committees around other protected areas. The government is even considering expanding the designated area of the Buffer Zone
                at Tambopata, assuming the Local Management Committee can extend its good work. Committee members are concerned about this expansion given they already feel overwhelmed
                with their current work.</p>

            <p>In Feb 2019, Peru’s government launched ‘Operation Mercury,’ a multisector governmental operation to confront the illegal mining crisis in this region. This crackdown has
                significantly slowed gold mining deforestation in the Buffer Zone and kept it from penetrating the Tambopata National Reserve and the Bahuaja Sonene National Park.</p>

            <h3><i>Did the participatory zoning exercise improve local leadership & technical planning skills?</i></h3>

            <p><b><i>Successes! </i></b>Stakeholders’ involvement in the exercise allowed them to build new institutions to support decision making.  Many zoning participants became
                members of a steering committee to oversee the buffer zone (see note above about the Local Management Committee).</p>

            <h3><i>Did the participatory zoning exercise protect areas of special ecological importance?</i></h3>

            <p><b><i>Mixed Results: </i></b>The Malinowski River, an important headwater, was severely damaged by mining despite zoning protection. Most forest is protected in the
                Tambopata Reserve and the Bahuaja-Sonene Park.</p>

        <h2>Challenges & Uncertainties of Participatory Zoning efforts</h2>
            <p><b><i>HIGHLY POLITICAL?</i></b><br>Yes, very! Zoning is not just about <u>where</u> resources will be used, but <u>who</u> gets access.</p>

            <p><b><i>SLOW?</i></b><br>Yes, this was a >5-year process. The government then spent more than a year after the roundtable formalizing and adjusting the map chosen at
                the round table. Zoning is still adjusted every couple of years, but each time, it builds on previous zoning efforts and concerns a smaller area.</p>

            <p><b><i>DEMOCRATIC?</i></b><br>Was Tambopata zoning coercive or democratic? Miners and loggers were not even invited to the roundtable because conservationists
                thought their activities were not compatible with TNR goals. (What do YOU think, should miners have been invited?). Some indigenous people felt the exercise was
                a waste of time.</p>

            <p><b><i>INEFFECTIVE?</i></b><br>Note that pluralistic processes like participatory land use zoning tend to favor ambiguous rules for zones (e.g. the community
                reserve zone). Why do you think this is true? Ambiguity makes subsequent enforcement difficult.  Also, in this case (like many others), donors funded the
                zoning exercise (US$ 500k total) but did not provide funds for subsequent enforcement. Why not?</p>

        <p><b><span class = "bigText">TAKEAWAY: </span>Participatory zoning is an example of community-engaged conservation. It is slow, politically fraught work, but key to
            enduring land stewardship. Also remember, local zoning efforts are inadequate to defend land from activities like mining. Controlling a high-profit, highly
            destructive activity like mining requires both community engagement and interventions from government agencies. </b></p>
