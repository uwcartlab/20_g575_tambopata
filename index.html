				<h2>About the Assignment</h2>
				<p>
					In this exercise, you will assume the role of a real-life stakeholder from Tambopata. Based on your stakeholder’s interests, you will define your land-use priorities for TNR, find allies, and negotiate with your opponents
					as you collectively negotiate and vote on one of four zoning proposal maps created in the local participatory planning process. In thinking about which map should guide land use activities in Tambopata’s future,
					consider the following: Why do your interests deserve priority? What kinds of activities will generate income without destroying biodiversity? Does your character have special interest in a certain area, e.g. the fertile,
					gold-rich and scenic riversides? Which areas have old-growth forests? Conversely, which areas are already deforested? Which activities are taking place up-stream from your character’s areas of interest?
					You will advocate for your stakeholder’s vision for sustainable development in Tambopata by participating in a role-played roundtable and writing a ~1200-1400 words position paper. At the roundtable and in the paper,
					you will identify the map you think best matches your character’s priorities, and (most importantly) defend your character’s position using moral, environmental and/or economic arguments (choosing arguments that are most appropriate
					to your character; you don’t have to make all three):
				</p><p>
					<u><b>Moral Arguments:</u></b> Who should benefit from Tambopata’s forests and why? The area's original indigenous inhabitants? Or the largest group, namely small-scale farmers of mixed ancestry,
					some of whom have lived in Tambopata for decades, others only a few years? Which kinds of land use activities can offer security for Tambopata’s residents?
					Do Tambopata's forests and wildlife deserve protection apart from human economic concerns?
				</p><p>
					<u><b>Environmental Arguments:</u></b> What land uses are most likely to maintain biodiversity and/or other ecosystem services? How can environmentally destructive practices be mitigated?
					Why should certain activities be conducted in certain areas of TNR (e.g. where does old growth forest persist? where has forest already been cleared?
					Which areas are up/down stream? Which areas are closer to the Bahuaja-Sonene National Park?)?
				</p><p>
					<u><b>Economic Arguments:</u></b> Tambopata is poor. What kind of economic activities should have priority? Why? Which kinds of land use activities can generate capital and taxes to improve Tambopata’s services?

				<h2>About Tambopata</h2>
				<p>
					The Tambopata National Reserve (TNR) (Spanish: Reserva Nacional Tambopata) is a nature reserve in the Amazon Basin in Peru, South America. It was created on January 26, 1990 to protect the forests adjacent to the rivers.
					Inhabited by 165 species and 41 families of trees, 103 species of mammals, 1300 species of butterflies and 90 species of amphibians, the reserve has important ecosystems and are noted for its biodiversity.
					The reserve can be accessed from Puerto Maldonado, via either: (1) Tambopata River; or (2) by car through the Puerto Maldonado–Cuzco road.
				</p><p>
				<p>
					Tambopata is one of the most biologically diverse and least disturbed areas on the planet. Ecologists want to save this wild area. Many indigenous people see their very survival threatened by development,
					but most local residents see Tambopata as a poor region of Peru that contains untapped reserves of timber, gold and farmland. To balance biodiversity protection with economic development,
					officials are promoting participatory land-use zoning. Specifically, they are zoning the 272,000 hectares of land within Tambopata National Reserve, an area intended to both protect biodiversity and allow for sustainable resource use.
				</p><p>
				<p>
					Leading this zoning exercise is Peru’s Ministry of the Environment. The Ministry has invited certain stakeholders and groups to propose zoning maps and promote their map at a public roundtable.
					The map selected at the roundtable will guide future management and influence funding decisions. Click here to read about the assignment.
